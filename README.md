- üí¨ Language: English (en); ‰∏≠Êñá (zh);
- üìÑ Research: Deep Learning; Computer Vision; Fine-tuning; Long-tailed Recognition;
- üß∞ Development: Golang; Python;

## ‚úçÔ∏è Blog & Personal Website
I maintain a blog `xxx` and a personal website `lincoding.cn`. You can find my articles and some demos in these two.

## üî® Project

### üß† Artificial Intelligence
- [YuMJie/ConCutMix](https://github.com/YuMJie/ConCutMix): *A novel data augmentation method for long-tailed reconition, which constructs semantic consistent label for the synthetic samples generated by CutMix.*
- [PanHaulin/COIN](https://github.com/PanHaulin/COIN): *A novel two-stage fine-tuning method for improving the performance of self-supervised model on various downstream datasets by supervised contrastive learning.*
- [qinyideng/ccl](https://github.com/qinyideng/ccl): *A novel constrastive complementary labeling strategy, which constructs reliable negative pairs for contrastive learning to enhance existing semi-supervised methods.*
- [PanHaulin/CFNPM](https://github.com/PanHaulin/COIN): *An attempt to combine traditional machine learning methods with deep learning based on gradient optimization. Due to a change in research direction, it has been temporarily put on hold.*


### üåê Web
- [PanHaulin/KV-Server (MIT-6.824)](): *The implementation of experiments of the course `MIT-6.824`. Considering the course requirements, only docutments about important designs are provided. In addition, a logging plugin is provided to assist with debugging.*
- [PanHaulin/Go-Cloud-Storage](https://github.com/PanHaulin/go-cloud-fileserver): *A cloud storage service implemented using the `Gin`, which has currently completed basic file transfer and storage features. More features will be added latter.*
- [PanHaulin/Markdown-Note-WeApp](https://github.com/PanHaulin/Markdown-Note-WeApp): *A Markdown based note wechat mini program, which is easier to record than traditional note software, and easier to read than system sticky notes. Only the codes that I code with js are provided.
- [PanHaulin/EDET](): *An epidemic dynamic evaluation and tracking system. Only a brief design document is provided here.*

### üóÇÔ∏è Others
- [PanHaulin/Course-Demo](): Some demo implemented in response to course requirements, including a odd-even-sort mpi demo, a demo for solving mathematical problems based on seq2seq language model, a demo to calculate the number of combinations, and so on.
- [PanHaulin/Paper-Reproduction](https://github.com/PanHaulin/Paper-Reproduction): the Archives of paper reproduction results.
- Supply-Chain-Demand-Forecasting: The code for competition of CCF-BDCI 2018 (Not Opensource).
